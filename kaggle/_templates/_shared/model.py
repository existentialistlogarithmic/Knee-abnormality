# ImageNet statistics. Every pretrained backbone here — torchvision and DINOv2
# alike — was trained on inputs normalised this way. The earliest runs fed raw
# 0..1 values straight in, which shifts the input distribution away from what
# the pretrained filters expect and quietly costs transfer quality. It never
# errors; it just makes the pretrained weights worth less than they should be.
#
# It is therefore a property of a trained model, not a preference: INPUT_NORM
# comes from the manifest at training time and from the checkpoint at inference
# time, and mixing the two in an ensemble is refused rather than averaged.
